# Mongosh scripts

Here you can find some scripts that can be run using mongosh to setup or update our mongodb database.

You can run the scripts using the following command in the terminal:

    mongosh --file FILENAME

- [`setup-schemas.js`](./setup-schemas.js): add schema validation to our collections.
- [`reset-db.js`](./reset-db.js): delete all data from the database (schema and other configuration is kept).
